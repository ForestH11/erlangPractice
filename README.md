# Overview

This is a basic Erlang Syntax Sampler. I wrote a simple erlang file for several different types of common syntax in the erlang language

I wanted to gain a better understanding of erlang as a language, and of the functional programming paradigm in general

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code.  Focus should be on sharing what you learned about the language syntax.}

# Development Environment

I worked in VS Code to write and execute these on a Windows 10 machine

Using Erlang Shell 13.0
    Erlang/OTP 25

* [Erlang Documentation](https://www.erlang.org/doc/reference_manual/introduction.html)

# Future Work

* Continue playing with, and learning this language
* Go to each of the FIXMEs and expand the code with more examples
